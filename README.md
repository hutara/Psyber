## Features
- Audio synthesys via multiple engines ([Monosynth](https://dilber.io/docs/index.html#instruments-monosynth), [Polysynth](https://dilber.io/docs/index.html#instruments-synth), [FM synth](https://dilber.io/docs/index.html#instruments-fm) ...)
- Video synthesys using [Hydra Video Synth](https://hydra.ojack.xyz/), [P5.js](https://p5js.org/) and [Marching.js](https://github.com/charlieroberts/marching)
- Audio and video sequencing (gibber, step sequencing, tydalcycles/strudel)
- Over 40 tutorials and demos on how to use
- Over 3000 tunings and scales, see https://dilber.io/scales.html
- Sample sources supported: `local files, online files, microphone recording, musicgen AI model`
- Sample mangling (see [sampler docs](https://dilber.io/docs/index.html#instruments-sampler))
- Record samples with your mic/audio in using `recordMic(<seconds>)`, defaults to 5 seconds recordings
- Generate samples locally with `musicgen(<prompt>,<shortname>)` for more sample choices
- Create your own synths with oscilators, envelopes, lfos and more...
- Supported sample formats are `wav, aif, mp3, aiff`
- Audio in via command: `FFT.startMic()` - check Audio In tutorial
- Audio effects <i>(BitCrusher, Delay, Filter, Distortion, Flanger, Reverb, RingMod, Vibrato, Tremolo, Wavefolder)</i>
- Video effects <i>(Antialiasing, Bloom, Blur, Brightness, Contrast, Edges, Focus, Godrays, Motion Blur, Hue, Invert)</i>
- Camera control <i>(WASD, arrows)</i>
- MouseX and MouseY tracking
- Works offline!
- Saving and loading your dilber files from computer
- MIDI out for your external or hardware synths
- Share your code with others instantly
- Custom toast messages when there is an error in the code
- Soundfont support (Asprin, Chaos, GeneralUserGS, and JCLive)
- Custom server support, check out [server script](resources/dilber-server.js)
- Custom background via `bg(<url>)` command - check `backgrounds` tutorial in app
- Sequence gifs via `bg.seq([image_array], [duration_array], random=true)`
- Record your audio (system+mic) and video performance via `recordSession()` and `stopSession()`
- Autosave - in case of a crash it stores your code accross sessions. Default interval is set to 30 minutes. It can be turned off or customized.
- Spectator mode - after creating a session in perform mode, a spectator link is copied to your clipboard. Paste it anyhere to invite people to spectate your performance live. 
- [Soon] P2P realtime collaboration with shared editor and chat over secure sockets

## Visual libraries
     - 3D Raymarching
     - Hydra
     - P5.js

## Use online samples with Sampler instrument
```
- Use a direct link to your sample as a parameter: Sampler('https://somewebsite.come/awesomesample.wav')

- Use any sound from Freesound.org library by ID: 
     Freesound(4048)

- Download samples by query: 
     Freesound('crickets')

- Get random samples:
     Freesound({ 
          query:'drums +90 +bpm', // search for drums, 90, and bpm
          max:5, 			    // max of five seconds in length
          single:false, 		    // files do not have to contain single sounds / notes
          filename:false,         // do not require query terms to be present in filename
          count:5,			    // load five samples...
          maxVoices:1		    // ... but only play one at a time
     })
```

## Use local samples with Sampler
```
 - Clone this repo and put your samples in `samples` folder
 - Open index.html on your local machine (you can use http-server or LiveServer in VS Code)
 - Use it in your code like a normal instrument: Sampler('yoursample.wav')

 or

 - Use local audio model to generate new samples for you e.g. `musicgen('90s drum beat heavy 120 bpm', 'drum2')
 - Use it in your code: Sampler('drum2.gen')

 or

 - Record a sample via microphone in your browser with `recordMic()` command
 - Use it in your code: Sampler('<recording-name>.rec')
```



## Sequence external synths
```
 - Click on `midi out` button in top menu and select MIDI out device 
 - Send a MIDI NoteOn message with a value of 60 to channel 0: channels[0].midinote(60)
 - See MIDI Out tutorial in Dilber for more!
```

## Running custom wss server
- You can find server script here [dilber-server](resources/dilber-server.js) 
- Feel free to clone and setup your own server over SSL
