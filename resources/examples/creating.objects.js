# Creating & using audiovisual objects
This tutorial looks at how to make audio and visual objects, and store 
them so we can change their properties and tell them to do tasks.
--*/

Synth()


/*--md
By placing parenthesis after the name of the constructor, we call it and tell it
to make a new object. In many cases, we want to store that object so that we can
use it later. We can do that by assigning it to a variable.
--*/

syn = Synth()


/*--md
Now that we have a variable holding our synth, we can use tell our synth to play a note:
--*/

syn.note( 0 )


/*--md
In this case, the synth plays the first note in Dilber's default scale (learn 
more in the theory tutorial). We can also change properties of our synth:
--*/

syn.octave = -2
syn.note( 0 )


/*--md
In the code above, we assign a value to our synth's octave property, and then
tell it to play a note, which is now two octaves lower.

The same ideas (constructors, properties, and methods) also apply to graphics:
--*/

sphere = Sphere()
sphere.radius = 2
sphere.render()


/*--md
Press `Ctrl+Period` to clear the current scene. When we create new audiovisual objects,
there are two types of info we can pass to the constructors. The first is the name of a "preset", which
is just a collection of values that are assigned to an object's properties.
--*/

syn = Synth( 'acidBass2' )
syn.note( 0 )


/*--md
Note that the synth has a very different
sound and is in a lower octave by default;
this is due to the information stored in
the preset. Preset names must be passed
inside of quotation marks; in programming
we call this information "strings". You
can see a list of all presets related to
an instrument by calling the `.list()`
method (e.g. `Synth.list()` or `FM.list()`),
then check console output.

We can also pass custom property values to 
constructors. For example:
--*/

syn = Synth({ octave:-2, Q:.9, decay:1 })
syn.note( 0 )

// the above is just a shorthand for:
syn = Synth()
syn.octave = -2
syn.Q = .9
syn.decay = 1
syn.note( 0 )


// We can also pass a preset first, and then 
// pass a set of properties to a constructor:

syn = Synth( 'bleep', { waveform:'saw', shape:'exponential' })
syn.note( 0 )


/*--md
after you create new object, you can get a list of the tasks it can do and the properties it 
has by just typing the name of the variable you stored the object in and hitting the period key.
This is the easiest way to get a sense of the options available for each object. Once this list
is displayed you can use the arrow keys to scroll through it and read about each property/function.
Try type `syn.` below to see its list:
