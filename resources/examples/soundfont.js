/* Soundfonts Tutorial
** Soundfonts are collections of samples that 
** typically follow the General MIDI specification:
** 
** https://pjb.com.au/muscript/gm.html#patch
**
** They're probably the best tool in dilber
** to get instruments that sound "real"... think
** an acoustic piano or bowed cello. That said
** they are not high-quality samples... really
** good sample sets are huge in filesize and not
** well-suited for the web.
**
** Dilber includes access to 4 different banks
** of soundfonts made by different people. Some are
** taken from the great webaudiofont repository:
**
** https://github.com/surikov/webaudiofontdata
**
** The soundfonts dilber includes are, in order,
** Asprin, Chaos, GeneralUserGS, and JCLive.
** Let's try them out!

// s2 sounds more muted to me, I prefer it. There
// are five banks available (numbered 0-4); 0 is the default
// bank if none is specified. 

// you can also change the decay of the soundfont, which 
// defaults to one second... but it's an exponential decay
// so one second is fairly sharp. 

// decay measured in samples (sorry!)

// to see a list of all soundfonts, just place single
// quotes in between the parenthesis following the
