using hydra in dilber
   
Hydra Video Synth is an amazing system for (mostly) 2D graphics, primarily inspired by analog
video synthesizers, and created by Olivia Jack. You can play with it at:

https://hydra.ojack.xyz

We can "inject" hydra into dilber using the use() function, which will then 
download hydra and run it inside of dilber. This tutorial gives the details on how to
do that and some tricks for "listening" to dilber's musical instruments. For more info
on hydra itself, see the hydra website.

use( 'hydra' ).then( init => init() )

// it might take a second or two to download
// hydra, but once that's done we can run
// hydra commands just like in the hydra
// website:
osc().out()

// you'll notice that dilber puts a black
// background behind the code so that it
// remains (at least somewhat) legible. you
// might want to also hit the little upward
// arrow in the upper right corner, which will
// hide the dilber menu bar so the graphics can
// be viewed better.

// in hydra, any function argument can itself
// be a function, which will be evaluated once
// per frame of video. the following code
// will create a random number that will 
// determine that horizontal frequency of
// our oscillator:
osc( ()=> Math.random() * 50 ).out()

// clearing dilber (with ctrl+period) will
// stop hydra. You can also call hush() to
// do this without clearing audio/music.
hush()

// now that we know we can pass a function
// as any hydra parameter, all that we need
// to do is pass functions that provide the
// output of dilber instruments to get a/v
// synchronization. The __out property of
// instruments will give their current value.

k = Kick('long').trigger.seq( [.125,.5,2], 1/2 )
 
osc(100,.1,1)
  .kaleid( ()=> 2 + k.__out * 25 )
  .out()

// in order to make these types of mapping
// simpler, dilber adds a function .out()
// to every instrument that in turn returns
// a function giving it's value. You can
// also pass a argument to scale the output
// and to offset it. This means the code
// above can be shortened to:

k = Kick('long').trigger.seq( [.125,.5,2], 1/4 )
 
osc(100,.1,1)
  .kaleid( k.out(25,2) )
  .out()

// you might notice that the rise / fall
// in size of the square is a little hectic.
// by default, dilber tracks each sound over
// a window of 1024 samples. if we increase
// that number, we'll get smoother animations.
// if we decrease it, we'll get a sharper response
// to transients. Try changing the smooth variable
// below to values between 64 and 8192 to see the
// difference it makes:

smooth = 64
osc(100,.1,1)
  .kaleid( k.out(25,2,smooth) )
  .out()

// try it out using multiple instruments
// mapped to different hydra functions!

// dilber also has its own FFT functionality
// that you can use if you want to map with
// the overall spectrum of music instead of
// using individual components; the standard
// hydra FFT functions are not available. To
// start dilber's FFT running:

FFT.start()

// At this point you have access to FFT.low,
// FFT.mid, and FFT.high. Start with the kick
// below + hydra, and then add in the clave to
// see the effect.

kik = Kick('deep').trigger.seq( 1, 1/2 )

osc( 10,0,()=> FFT.low * 15 )
  .modulate( noise( ()=> FFT.high * 500 ) )
  .out()

clave = Clave().trigger.seq( 1, 1/2, 0, 1/4 )

/* increasing the window size (how many samples 
of audio the FFT looks at) will result in
smoother animations, while decreasing it will
results in quicker response to transients. 
The window size must be a power of 2 and 
defaults to 512; doubling and halving it is
an easy way to experiment with different sizes.
*/

// run multiple times for greater effect
FFT.windowSize *= 2

/* 
By default, the FFT assigns frequencies 
<150 Hz to FFT.low, 150-1400Hz to
FFT.mid, and all remaining frequencies
to FFT.high. However, you can also
define your own boundaries by passing
an array to FFT.start(); if you do this
the averages will then be in FFT[0], 
FFT[1], FFT[2] etc.

// 0: 0-100Hz
// 1: 100-500Hz
// 2: 500-2000Hz
// 3: 2000-22050Hz
FFT.start([100,500,2000,22050])

osc( 10,0,()=> FFT[0] * 15 )

// example how to initiate camera feed input
s0.initCam() //initialize webcam as external source 's0'
src(s0).out() // use external source 's0' inside Hydra

// set some effects on camera
src(s0).color(-1, 1).out()

// set some effects on camera
src(s0).color(-1, 1).kaleid().out()
